# vim-torch-snipmate
torch snipmate for Vim.        
This repo mainly provides Torch keywords highlighting and snippets specifically for Torch.

## Installation
If you are using [Vundle plugin management](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for Vim, just put in your ~/.vimrc file:
    
    Bundle 'jakezhaojb/vim-torch-snipmate'

And execute ":BundleInstall", then all set!

## Usage
For example, you'll no longer need to type "SpatialMaxPooling". Instead, use "smp"

## Others
I have lots of other Vim plugins, if you're interested, check out: TODO

## TODO
Add more!
